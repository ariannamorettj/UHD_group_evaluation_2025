                        European ethnographic museums experienced significant growth during the 19th century in a colonial context. Over the past 40 years, with the rise of <strong>post-colonial studies</strong>, the issue of <strong>decolonizing these problematic collections</strong> has become more relevant than ever.

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarr-Savoy_Report" target="_blank">Sarr-Savoy report</a>, first published in 2018, marked a turning point in collective awareness and highlighted the need to reassess the collections held in our ethnographic museums.

                        Nowadays, <strong>museums</strong> are central institutions for Western culture, and they are being increasingly criticized for their past in perpetuating <strong>colonial narratives</strong> and the ethical responsibilities they bear in addressing past injustices. A certain number of cultural artifacts that have been on display may have been acquired through <strong>imperial conquest</strong>, scientific expeditions, or unequal exchanges. Their display and conservation contribute to humanity due to their significant and shared historical value, uniting people beyond their political and religious differences.

                        During the 1950s, many nations gained <strong>independence</strong>, moved beyond the colonial era, and called for the return and restitution of their cultural heritage. A 1966 study conducted by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Council_of_Museums" target="_blank">International Council of Museums (ICOM)</a> highlighted key issues:

On the one hand, museums in Europe and North America hold vast collections of artworks from the world, amassed through extensive missions over the past centuries that enabled significant acquisitions. On the other hand, many newly independent nations, striving to build museums that reflect their own cultural heritage as well as global influences, often have very limited collections in this latter category."

                        The movement of the <strong>restitution of colonial era artifacts</strong> has gained monumental importance in recent decades by calling for the return and restitution of looted cultural heritage from the <strong>African and Asian communities</strong>. A very characteristic example is the <a href="#references">2018 Sarr-Savoy report</a> commissioned by the French government, which advocated for the systematic return of colonial objects held in European museums.<a href="#references">[3]</a>

                                    In most cases, the cultural objects in question were acquired through legal means, in accordance with the legal frameworks and geopolitical contexts of the time. However, if countries holding these objects were to return them, would this not imply an acknowledgment of their illicit acquisition? This concern often highlights the need for legislative changes. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_law" target="_blank">French legislation</a> maintains the <strong>inalienability</strong> of national collections, meaning that once an object enters a public museum, it cannot be legally sold, restituted, or transferred. Therefore, in such cases, restitution efforts are highly complex.<a href="#references">[5]</a>

                    <p>
                        While <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium" target="_blank">Belgium</a> is a relatively new State, gaining its independence only in 1830, it has played an active and bloody role in the colonization of the African continent, specifically in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo" target="_blank">Congo</a> but later also with influences in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwanda" target="_blank">Rwanda</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burundi" target="_blank">Burundi</a>. Belgium provides a unique case study of colonialism and imperialism, as the Congo was originally colonized to serve as the private property of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_II_of_Belgium" target="_blank">King Leopold II</a> between 1885 and 1908, thus excluding an official role for the Belgian State, but later became an official Belgian colony from 1908 and 1960, after increasing international diplomatic pressure due to violence used by colonial officers and the merciless economic extraction of rubber and ivory from the country.<a href="#references">[12]</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Appropriately remembering this colonial past comes with its own challenges, as an individual figure, King Leopold II, played a central role in the colonization of the Congo as its sole owner, but the role of the Belgian State should also not be downplayed. While King Leopold II passed away at the height of his unpopularity in 1909, the outbreak of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" target="_blank">First World War</a> led to the gravity of his crimes being forgotten. In fact, after the First World War, the Belgian government relied on the imagery of King Leopold II to strengthen its own colonial claims, thus leading to an increase in monuments dedicated to him in the Belgian public space.<a href="#references">[13]</a>

                        In Belgium, protests against the continued colonial presence in the public space already emerged around 2004, more than a decade before the widely spread <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodes_Must_Fall" target="_blank">Rhodes Must Fall Movement</a> in 2015. This public outrage, and subsequent vandalization of a few colonial monuments, was partly caused by the publication of the bestseller <em>King Leopold’s Ghost</em>, which brought Belgium’s colonial past to the attention of a broader audience, and the Belgian book <em>The Assassination of Lumumba</em>, which highlights the role of the Belgian government in the 1961 killing of the first prime minister of the Republic of Congo.<a href="#references">[13]</a>

                    <p>
                        After the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VRT_(broadcaster)" target="_blank">VRT</a>, the Flemish public broadcasting service, further exposed the atrocities authorized by King Leopold II in the Congo Free State in April 2004, three activists cut off the hand of one of the figures in a monument dedicated to King Leopold II in Ostend. Twenty years onwards, the hand is still missing – the activists are planning to literally take the hand to the grave with them unless the monument is removed to a museum which provides more context – and the figure was never restored <a href="https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2024/04/19/afgehakte-hand-van-oostendse-beeldengroep-ter-ere-van-leopold-ii/" target="_blank">[""].</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the 2010s, protests continued to grow against the continued presence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_II_of_Belgium" target="_blank">King Leopold II</a> in the Belgian public space, including the defacing of his equestrian statue in Brussels with red paint in 2008, 2013, and 2015 <a href="https://www.rtbf.be/article/parc-duden-a-forest-le-buste-de-leopold-ii-a-t-il-ete-deboulonne-durant-la-nuit-9808178" target="_blank">[""]</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Artists and activists also relied on temporary sculptures to make their point, such as the construction of an ice sculpture of King Leopold II to symbolize the need for his presence to melt away <a href="https://www.rektoverso.be/artikel/peopl-colonial-haunting-and-decolonial-dreams" target="_blank">[""]</a> or the reconstruction of a bust out of bird seed so it would slowly be pecked away by birds <a href="https://bx1.be/communes/forest/forest-imitation-graines-buste-de-leopold-ii-apparu-parc-duden/?theme=classic" target="_blank">[""]</a>.

                    <p>
                        Since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter" target="_blank">Black Lives Matter</a> movement in 2020, there has been a rapid increase in criticism regarding the colonial statues still standing in Belgium. While public authorities continue to repair damaged monuments, there has also been a gradually growing number of plaques being added since 2009 to provide more context. Moreover, since 2018, public squares and streets have also increasingly been renamed, and since 2020, more statues have been removed<a href="#references">[13]</a>.

                        In 2020, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Federal_Parliament" target="_blank">Belgian Federal Parliament</a> also established the “Colonial Past Commission” <a href="https://migrant-integration.ec.europa.eu/news/belgium-colonial-past-commission-addresses-issues-raised-belgian-congolese-and-belgian-rwandan_en" target="_blank">[""]</a>.

                    <h4>Alternative heritage practices to make visible the trouble around these heritage monuments/objects (artistic intervention, walking tour)</h4>
                    <p>
                        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Museum_for_Central_Africa" target="_blank">AfricaMuseum</a> in Brussels finds its origins in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World%27s_fair" target="_blank">International Exposition</a> of 1897. After the Exposition, King Leopold II requested the move of the ‘Colonial Section’ to the Africa Palace in Tervuren, including geographic samples, animals and ethnographic objects. In the surrounding park, an African village was recreated housing several Congolese individuals, seven of whom died while living there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_II_of_Belgium" target="_blank">King Leopold II</a>, the museum was a propaganda tool to garner support for his imperial project, and the Africa Palace became a permanent museum of the Congo in 1898, including an institute for scientific research. In 1908, after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_Free_State" target="_blank">Congo Free State</a> became the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Congo" target="_blank">Belgian Congo</a>, the museum was renamed as the Museum of Belgian Congo until it became the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Museum_for_Central_Africa" target="_blank">Royal Museum of the Belgian Congo</a> in 1952.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After the Congo declared its independence in 1960, the museum was rechristened again to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Museum_for_Central_Africa" target="_blank">Royal Museum of Central Africa</a> <a href="https://www.africamuseum.be/en/discover/history?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAoJC-BhCSARIsAPhdfSiuAnb5MDgnjQxFFwB6wL5n1VPaxl58asdqmlsc_QQd0YnjIGRFgc0aAvQlEALw_wcB" target="_blank">[""]</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Between 2015 and 2018, the museum was closed for renovations to update the exhibition and infrastructure to present decolonized perspectives on Africa in a setting which had historically been constructed as colonial propaganda <a href="https://www.africamuseum.be/en/about_us/history_renovation" target="_blank">[""].</a>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Since 2018, the museum communicates, and is more commonly known, under the name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Museum_for_Central_Africa" target="_blank">AfricaMuseum</a>, even though its official name is still the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Museum_for_Central_Africa" target="_blank">Royal Museum for Central Africa</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the building housing the collection is listed as a protected immovable heritage site, the museum struggled to sufficiently alter the space during the renovations to create a decolonized space. For instance, the grand rotunda contains multiple colonial statues, but when the AfricaMuseum was considering their removal, the <a href="https://www.onroerenderfgoed.be/" target="_blank">Flanders Heritage Agency</a> argued that this would damage an integral part of the listed building.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In response, the AfricaMuseum launched an international competition for an art piece which would counterbalance these colonial statues. The work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aim%C3%A9_Mpane" target="_blank">Aimé Mpane</a>, a Congolese artist, was selected, but soon after the installation of his work, visitors continued to indicate the decolonization of the space was insufficient. Moreover, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Human_Rights_Council" target="_blank">UN Human Rights Council</a> called on the museum to remove all colonial propaganda. Following these reactions, Aimé Mpane constructed a second sculpture in the space and worked with <a href="https://jeanpierremuller.be/" target="_blank">Jean-Pierre Müller</a>, a Belgian artist, to hang sixteen semi-transparent veils in front of the existing statues with prints of contemporary images, causing a juxtaposition and new reading of the colonial and immovable heritage <a href="https://www.africamuseum.be/en/about_us/history_renovation" target="_blank">[""]</a>.

                    <h4>Current Stance on Colonization</h4>
                    <p>
                        Today, the AfricaMuseum describes its position on colonization as follows:
                    </p>

                    <blockquote>
                        “Colonialism is a form of government based on military occupation, authoritarian and racist administration, and exploitation. The museum therefore explicitly distances itself from it. It takes responsibility for the impact that its previous propaganda for colonialism has had on the multicultural society of today, and for the message of Western moral and intellectual superiority it has conveyed in the past. The museum intends to be a forum for opinions and views on the historical, current and future relationship with Central Africa” <a href="https://www.africamuseum.be/en/about_us/viewpoints" target="_blank">[""].</a>
                    </blockquote>
                    <h4>Restitution and Legal Ownership</h4>
                    <p>
                        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Museum_for_Central_Africa" target="_blank">AfricaMuseum</a> itself cannot make any decisions affecting the ownership of its collections, since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium" target="_blank">Belgian Federal State</a> remains their legal owner. Decisions on restitution must thus be made by the <a href="https://www.belspo.be/belspo/organisation/org_wet_en.stm" target="_blank">Federal State Secretary for Science Policy</a> in accordance with Belgian legislation and with parliamentary approval.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A bill was adopted by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Federal_Parliament" target="_blank">Federal Parliament</a> in July 2022 specifying the need for a treaty between the Belgian State and the State of origin before the restitution of property can be made possible. Such a treaty is currently being drafted between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium" target="_blank">Belgium</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo" target="_blank">Congo</a>, and would require the establishment of a joint Congolese-Belgian commission to assess the provenance of the objects concerned <a href="https://www.africamuseum.be/en/about_us/viewpoints" target="_blank">[""]</a>.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Provenance Research and Collections</h4>
                    <p>
                        Since September 2022, the AfricaMuseum has been working on a research project regarding the provenance of the museum’s ethnographic collections together with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institut_des_Mus%C3%A9es_Nationaux_du_Congo" target="_blank">Institut des Musées Nationaux du Congo</a>. Moreover, in 2021, the AfricaMuseum launched a ‘provenance trail’ with a smartphone-guided tour to bring its provenance research results to visitors of the collection <a href="https://www.africamuseum.be/en/about_us/viewpoints" target="_blank">[""]</a>.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Human Remains and Ethical Concerns</h4>
                    <p>
                        In its collection, the AfricaMuseum also houses two mummified persons since 1919. Previously, the museum also still held other skulls and human remains, although most were moved in 1964 to the <a href="https://www.naturalsciences.be/en/museum" target="_blank">Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences</a>, where they can still be found today, after the museum’s department of physical anthropology was closed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Moreover, the museum also has several ethnographic objects partly made from human remains, such as a horn with a piece of jawbone. The AfricaMuseum collaborates with six other institutions to evaluate the background of these remains as part of the <a href="https://www.africamuseum.be/en/research/home-project" target="_blank">HOME project (Human Remains Origin(s) Multidisciplinary Evaluation)</a> <a href="https://www.africamuseum.be/en/about_us/viewpoints" target="_blank">[""]</a>.

                            Currently holding about 350,000 objects, 200,000 images, and 350,000 library elements, the three ethnological museums in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig" target="_blank">Leipzig</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dresden" target="_blank">Dresden</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herrnhut" target="_blank">Herrnhut</a> form the second-largest collection of its kind in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany" target="_blank">Germany</a>. These museums, part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staatliche_Kunstsammlungen_Dresden" target="_blank">Saxon State Art Collections (Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden)</a>, have been actively examining their colonial past since 2010.

                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">A diplomatic approach of restitution?</h3>
                </div>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>
                        The <strong>Fare Iamanaha – Museum of Tahiti and the Islands (MTI)</strong> was renamed <strong>Fare Iamanaha</strong> upon its reopening in March 2023. This name change, emphasizing the <strong>Tahitian language</strong>, reflects a desire to assert a renewed cultural identity<a href="#references">[14]</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Recent developments at the MTI, including the <strong>reconstruction of the permanent exhibition hall</strong>
                        <a href="https://www.museetahiti.pf/salle-permanente/" target="_blank">["]</a>
                        and projects to <strong>repatriate Polynesian objects</strong> previously held in institutions in Paris, London, and Cambridge, illustrate this new dynamic of <strong>cultural reappropriation in Polynesia</strong>. These initiatives have strengthened ties between the MTI and museums such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mus%C3%A9e_du_quai_Branly" target="_blank">Musée du quai Branly – Jacques Chirac</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Museum" target="_blank">British Museum</a>, and the <a href="https://www.museums.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology at the University of Cambridge</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This connection is notably embodied by the concept of the <strong>“ambassador object”</strong> — Polynesian artifacts that, when exhibited abroad, serve as <strong>cultural representatives</strong>, fostering relationships between museums and promoting a form of <strong>cultural sovereignty</strong> that transcends physical presence. This approach contrasts with a sovereignty focused solely on the <strong>physical restitution of artifacts</strong>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The concept of <strong>“ambassador objects”</strong> is based on the idea that certain heritage objects, even when not physically present in their place of origin, can still play an active role in preserving and promoting a people’s <strong>cultural identity</strong>. For instance, artifacts of the <a href="#references">MTI</a> were displayed as ambassador objects in major western museums. Rather than viewing it simply as an artifact removed from its original context, this concept is seen as an opportunity to <strong>showcase Polynesian culture</strong> on the global stage. The object thus becomes an <strong>“ambassador”</strong>: it tells the story of the people who created it, draws attention to their heritage, and raises worldwide awareness of <strong>Polynesian traditions</strong> <a href="#references">[11]</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>This approach offers very concrete benefits:</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong class="concl">Global cultural visibility:</strong> Objects exhibited abroad carry the voice of their cultures, sparking curiosity and understanding among visitors.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong class="concl">Partnerships and exchanges:</strong> Collaborations between local and international museums facilitate <strong>knowledge exchange</strong>, joint research, and sometimes artifact loans for temporary exhibitions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong class="concl">Cultural sovereignty without immediate physical restitution:</strong> Rather than focusing solely on the return of objects, this approach acknowledges that <strong>culture can thrive even at a distance</strong> while advocating for forms of <strong>shared or co-managed collections</strong>.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        This does not mean that <strong>restitution</strong> is unimportant. But this vision nuances the debate: <strong>cultural sovereignty</strong> is not limited to physically possessing objects. It can also be built by affirming communities’ ability to <strong>tell their own stories</strong>, even when their artifacts are abroad, while ensuring that these objects are <strong>treated with respect</strong> and properly contextualized in <strong>Western museums</strong>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is a form of <strong>cultural diplomacy</strong>, where artifacts become <strong>bridges between cultures</strong> rather than mere objects of possession. It also shows that restoring <strong>symbolic ties</strong> to objects can sometimes be just as powerful as <strong>material restitution</strong>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The collaborative exhibition <em>“Maro ‘ura. A Polynesian Treasure”</em> (2021–2022) at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musée_du_quai_Branly" target="_blank">Musée du quai Branly – Jacques Chirac</a> is an example of this policy. The <strong>Maro’ura</strong> (a sacred royal belt) was exhibited as an <strong>ambassador object</strong>. Rather than being limited to a permanent return, the temporary exhibition of the Maro helped to illustrate the <strong>cooperation between institutions</strong> to enhance <strong>Polynesian heritage</strong> <a href="#">["]</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>In conclusion</strong>, the <a href="#references">MTI</a>, as a cultural institution, plays a central role in <strong>redefining Polynesian cultural sovereignty</strong>. By encouraging the <strong>circulation of collections</strong> and establishing <strong>international partnerships</strong>, the museum actively contributes to the <strong>promotion and recognition of Polynesian heritage</strong> on the global stage.

                                        The <strong class="concl"><em>AfricaMuseum</em></strong> is being renovated to tie Belgium's <strong><em>colonial past</em></strong> into the exhibition. The museum has <strong><em>decolonized aspects</em></strong> of its space—including installation art to counterbalance colonial statues, but the process continues. The museum has been decolonizing through discussions of returning cultural objects, showing that <strong><em>decolonization is a journey</em></strong>.
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                                        The <strong class="concl"><em>Grassi Museum</em></strong> of Leipzig is transparent through its <strong><em>engagement with source communities</em></strong> for the return of objects. It has continued to return items, such as the <strong><em>Benin Bronzes</em></strong>, and established an online platform to share decolonization information. Last but not least, the museum further reexamines its story and identity, while emphasizing <strong><em>dialogue and reflection</em></strong> as central to meaningful change.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>

                                        The <strong class="concl"><em>Te Fare Iamanaha Museum</em></strong> of Tahiti and the concept of the <strong><em>"ambassador object"</em></strong> is discussed. It is more of an instrument to showcase the Polynesian culture to the world while creating strong <strong><em>cultural linkages and sovereignty</em></strong> that deal with such objects without having to return them. Also in that case, highlighting another aspect of <strong><em>cultural diplomacy</em></strong> and collaborations between museums even though in rare cases, there could be a requirement for <strong><em>physical restitution</em></strong>.
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                            <p>
                                All three cases demonstrate that <strong><em>decolonization at museums goes beyond object-repatriation</em></strong>; it paves the way toward a much more inclusive, respectful, and still dialogue regarding history. Each museum is carving out its own way to respect the cultures and communities affected by <strong><em>colonialism</em></strong>, which indeed becomes important for the future of <strong><em>cultural institutions</em></strong> and generations.

                            <p class="text-muted">With a background in art and archaeology from my Bachelor’s and first Master’s in History of Art, I specialized in cultural heritage preservation, particularly in conflict contexts. During my second Master’s in conservation-restoration, I developed a restoration protocol for ceramics damaged in war. My thesis examines bomb-induced damage on ceramics from the National Ceramic Museum in Sèvres and the MIC in Faenza, analyzing the effects of blast, shock, and fire on different materials. This research aims to improve restoration protocols, aiding professionals in sorting and restoring post-conflict debris efficiently.</p>
